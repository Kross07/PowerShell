# PowerShell Scripts

<b>1. UnwantedAppsUninstall.ps1</b>

<blockquote>This script seeks to uninstall a lot of low-hanging bloat that comes with Windows 11. This is not an all-encompassing list by any means, but it is a starting list of what I wanted to remove based on my own preferences. The script will ask the user if they want to uninstall the application (y/n) before doing so.

Friendly reminder that you cannot uninstall the Start Menu Shortcut Apps via powershell. Or at least I couldn't find a way to do it. They aren't really "installed". They will install when you run them for the first time. You'll still have to remove the shortcuts like "tiktok", "ESPN", or "Instagram" manually by right clicking and clicking "uninstall". </blockquote>
